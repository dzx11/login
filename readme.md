To run, serve the files on a web server and access the index.html, e.g. http://localhost:8080/index.html. For an example
web server, install node.js if it is not already installed, and install 'http-server' with
'npm install -g http-server'
then run the server in the working directory with
'http-server'
and access the web url above. If a server is not used, then you will not be able to view the content correctly in Google
Chrome by default.
